# Unbiased quantification of the spatial distribution of cells using Point pattern analysis (PPA)(StarProtocols).

This repository contains the material associated with the Star Protocol for Point Pattern Analysis (PPA) (XXXXXXx). 

## Files

`Atlas_Regions.csv` is a dictionary containing brain area names and acronyms. It is useful to set up an automatic pipeline for cell counting in specific regions using QuPath. 
`SingleImage_Processing.qmd` Annotated Quarto notebook (https://quarto.org/) for single image processing. This notebook was created using R. 
`BatchImage_Processing.qmd` Annotated Quarto notebook (https://quarto.org/) for batch image processing. Please note that  this notebook is associated with a recent publication by our research group (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.10.04.560910v1). 

## Dependencies
